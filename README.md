# HEART DISEASE PREDICTOR

Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects you’re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.
With the use of UCI Kaggle dataset I have built a Machine Learning techniques to classify whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.

## TECH STACKS

Libraries of Python :
-Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Warnings
- RandomForestClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier

To get correlation of each feature in the data set Plot Heat Map is generated

## About the dataset

This is a multivariate type of dataset which means providing or involving a variety of separate mathematical or statistical variables, multivariate numerical data analysis. It is composed of 14 attributes which are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak — ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels and Thalassemia. This database includes 76 attributes, but all published studies relate to the use of a subset of 14 of them. The Cleveland database is the only one used by ML researchers to date. One of the major tasks on this dataset is to predict based on the given attributes of a patient that whether that particular person has heart disease or not and other is the experimental task to diagnose and find out various insights from this dataset which could help in understanding the problem more.


## Deployment

I have used Google Collab Notebook to Deploy this Project

Deploying it with Flask :

## Further Pipeline of development

As the next step of Development I would like to make it a user-friendly website where the user can input their details or answer a few questions and the model can predict their heart health.
